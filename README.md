# Prism Theatre website

# Prism Theatre
The website is for the amateur dramatic company Prism Theatre. It allows people to buy tickets for upcoming performances, learn about the company and their past, present, future shows. It gives the company a central hub where they can provide information, sell tickets and promote their shows.

# Features

## Home Page 


## About us page
The About Us page contains:
- a hero image of the company at a past concert.
- the company manifesto.
- quick navigation buttons at the button of the page and a navigation area at the top left of the page.

The hero image is a background image which doesn't move but of which more will be displayed depending on which size of screen is used. The text is across the hero image and is responsive to screen size also.


## Past shows gallery
The past shows page contains:
- a photo gallery of a past concert the group has performed.

The gallery is responsive so that on mobile, there is one column of photos; on larger/landscape mobiles there are two columns of photos; on tablets/desktops there are three columns of photos. It it presented in a masonic layout to provide visual interest to the user. All photos have alt text so that, if an image link breaks or someone is using a screen reader, there is alternative text to read if necessary. 

## Current show page
The current show page contains:
- an image of the poster the group are currently rehearsing.
- information about the show.
- a link to the ticket page for users to buy tickets.
- an image of the cast in costume for the show.
- quick navigation buttons at the button of the page and a navigation area at the top left of the page.

## Future shows page
The future shows page contains:
- an image of a poster for the show which the group will be performing in the future.
- a link to the ticket page (accessed by clicking on the image of the poster).
- quick navigation buttons at the button of the page and a navigation area at the top left of the page.

  - An email input where the user's email is required.
  - A text-area input where the user can put their query as a required option.

# Design
The design was entirely focused around the Prism Theatre logo and principles:
- <img src="assets/images/prism-logo.png">
The Prism Theatre logo has a black background with a rainbow spectrum of colours as the central design - aligning with the name 'Prism'. Prism's values are diversity and inclusivity so all decisions were made with this in mind.
A deliberately uncluttered design was used to reduce cognitive overload; alt labels were used for all pictures and aria labels were used wherever links opened to new pages to improve the experience of people using screen readers. 
A black background was chosen to blend in with the background of the Prism logo and the logo was placed at the top of each page to ensure consistency. A white font was used as the most contrasting font against black to make the font easy to read. Sans-serif fonts are considered to be the easiest fonts to read by people who have autism or dyslexia so the sans-serif font 'Oswald' was chosen as the consistent font throughout the website: 
- <img src="assets/images/oswald-font.PNG">
The only outlier to this was for the "How to Survive a Zombie Apocalypse" ticket link where a red 'Creepster' font was used to add interest and a spooky feel.

# Testing

## Bugs

# Deployment
The site was deployed to GitHub. The link can be found [here](https://elamont174.github.io/prismtheatre/)


# Future improvements
- The website has been made with the intention of being cloned for use by Prism Theatre. 
- The contact form would be made fully functional so that the user's query would be directed to Prism Theatre's email address.
- As more shows are performed, the 'past/present/future' show pages would need to be updated appropriately. Moving forward, each show will have it's own page created for it so that it can easily be link ed from place to place, depending on what time frame is appropriate. The site would need to be maintained to allow this. The structure of the 'past shows' gallery would be altered tobe a central hub where these pages would link from.
